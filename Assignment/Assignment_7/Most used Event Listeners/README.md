#  Event Listener

The Event listener represent the interfaces responsible to handle events. Java provides us various Event listener classes. Every method of an event listener method has a single argument as an object which is subclass of EventObject class. For example, mouse event listener methods will accept instance of MouseEvent, where MouseEvent derives from EventObject.

import java.awt.*; 
import java.awt.event.*;  
class AEvent extends Frame implements ActionListener{  
  TextField tf;  
  AEvent(){

    tf=new TextField();  
    tf.setBounds(60,50,170,20);  
    Button b=new Button("click me");  
    b.setBounds(100,120,80,30);  
  
    //register listener  
    b.addActionListener(this);//passing current instance  
  
    //add components and set size, layout and visibility  
    add(b);add(tf);  
    setSize(300,300);  
    setLayout(null);  
    setVisible(true);  
  } 
  
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){  
    tf.setText("Welcome");
